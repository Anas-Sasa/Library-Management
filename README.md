# Library-Management

### A small, dependency-free Python command-line application to manage a simple books collection. 

> - It provides easy workflows to add books, check them out to borrowers, check them back in, and view available or borrowed titles. Data is kept in-memory for quick testing and learning.
---

- Purpose: teach and demonstrate basic CLI design, input validation, and simple data structures (dictionaries) in Python.

- Interaction: text-menu driven; run in a terminal and follow prompts.

- Limitations: no persistent storage (data resets when the program exits); intended as a learning/demo tool.
